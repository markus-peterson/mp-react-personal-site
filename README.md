# Personal Website Built with React

This repository is being used for the development and production of my personal website using react.
At the start of this development, I already have a version of my personal website deployed at markuspeterson.space, which only uses JQuery. I want to make a more polished website with more functionality and maybe even some 3D visuals using ThreeJS.
